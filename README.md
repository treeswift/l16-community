Umbrella project for L16 camera support and, God willing, revival

If you heard about the L16 multisensor camera, or own one, or even still carry one, this is our little lonely place to gather. I have a few cameras in my disposal available for tinkering and experimentation. I still carry one myself, especially for long-exposure nocturnal photography sessions.

The following resources are currently available for the few remaining loyal:
* [the most recent official L16 firmware - OTA sideload package](https://archive.org/details/lfc-1351-0-00-ww-a-01-update)
* [the most recent official Lumen build - companion software for PC and Mac](https://archive.org/details/lumen-for-l16)
* the [Issues](../../issues) page where you can leave feature requests or simply ask questions (e.g.: "Is there a Lightroom plugin for LRI?" "Will there be a Linux companion app?" "Can the camera be mounted on a drone?")

I am not paid for support, but pledge the best of my leisure time.

If you have ever worked for Light Labs, I can send you a camera free of charge. (Let me know if you don't want it upgraded to the latest firmware. Un-upgraded factory units are still on something like 1305 or 1306.)
